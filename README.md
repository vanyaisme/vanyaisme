## echo 'Hi there, people!'

My name is Ivan. Originally from Ukraine, I am currently a student of Neuroscience at Maastricht University. 
And what brought a Neuroscience student to GitHub? To be fair, I am not sure myself. 

I have always been curious about how technologies work and even tried to approach code several times throughout my life, but eventually abandoned the idea.
But now, after learning about the brain, I have found some interesting similarities in how AI is built and works, and decided to deep-dive here. Learning about implications, prompt engineering, tokenization, grokking, and other concepts—it's awakened my long-sleeping interest in code. 

And this time I decided to start with… the command line. 
So far, I finished a course here, finished a course there, went through OverTheWire and CMD challenges, and now I'm here. 

Let's see where this take me. Either way, thanks for stopping by! :)
